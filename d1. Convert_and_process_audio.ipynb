    "1. Convert the TEDLIUM sph files to wav\n",
    "    - you can pick how much of the sph to convert to wav\n",
    "2. Use PyAudioAnalysis to sample the audio and extract audio features for all the wav files.\n",
    "3. Write a dictionary with the audio features for all the wav files using pickle.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The audio files come from TED-LIUM 2, a corpus made from audio talks and their transcriptions available on the TED website in 2014 by the Laboratoire d'Informatique de l'Université du Maine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, go to the TEDLIUM II webpage, register, and download the dataset containing all the sph files.\n",

    "Set segmentLengths to the number of seconds of each sph file to convert to wav. Or, run \n",

    "Currently, I'm extracting minutes 2-6 of each talk (240 seconds).\n",

    "For the 240 second files, the files will be in data/wav240."
